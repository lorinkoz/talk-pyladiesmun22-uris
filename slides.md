# When 404 becomes 302

## The problem

.left-column-33[![Post with directions](images/directions.jpeg)]

--

- Moving fast

--

- Redefining the answer to .blue["what are we building?"]

--

- Our URLs didn't reflect the experience of the product anymore

--

- We knew some radical changes were needed

--

- We couldn't just get rid of the mess and change everything overnight

--

.right[.green[.emph[Cool URIs don't change]]]

class: middle center

When you change a URI on your server, you can never completely tell who will have links to the old URI [...] They might have bookmarked your page. They might have scrawled the URI in the margin of a letter to a friend.

URIs which we will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200 years

## The plan

---

--

1. Design .blue[new] URL structure

--

2. Mount in tandem with .red[old]

--

3. Redirect .red[old] to .blue[new]

--

4. Retire .red[old] URLs (eventually) ü§î

Phase 1: Design .blue[new]

Phase 2: .red[old] and .blue[new] both respond the same

Phase 3: .red[old] redirects to .blue[new]

Phase 4: .red[old] is removed, only .blue[new] remains

## Prerequisites

--

ü§ì Because we wanted to solve by code...

--

.left-column[

#### Framework

- ‚úÖ Named URLs
- ‚úÖ Namespaced URLs

]

--

.right-column[

#### Our code

- üòí Keep names in sync
- ‚úÖ Move old URLs to specific namespace

![Sign with a warning about code ahead](images/code-ahead.png)

---

## A middleware!

--

```python
def redirect_middleware(get_response):

    def middleware(request):
        response = get_response(request)

        if go_to_new := `should_go_to_new`(request)
            return redirect(go_to_new, permanent=True)

        return response

    return middleware
```

---

## A "should go to new" function!

--

```python
def should_go_to_new(request):
    if `we_want_to_handle`(request) and `is_old_url`(request):
        try:
            return `find_new_url`(request)
        except NoReverseMatch:
            # Because it's humans keeping things in sync
            logger.warning("üöß")

    return None

```

---

## Do we want to handle?

--

```python
def we_want_to_handle(request):
    return (
        response.status_code not in [301, 302]
        and request.method == "GET"  # Wait, why?
    )
```

--

.box[üí° Did you know there is also .green[307] and .green[308]?]

---

## Is old URL?

--

```python
def is_old_url(request):
    resolver_match = request.resolver_match

    # Having namespaced the old URLs comes in handy now
    return "old_namespace" in resolver_match.app_names
```

---

## Find new URL!

--

```python
def find_new_url(request):
    resolver_match = request.resolver_match

    # Ah yes, view comes with all namespaces prefixed
    view_name = resolver_match.view_name.split(":")[-1]

    return reverse(
        view_name,
        args=resolver_match.args,
        kwargs=resolver_match.kwargs
    )
```

- Adjusting the wording (e.g. replace "amendment" with "change order")
- Integrating multiple vanilla Django pages into single page with frontend component.

---

## The plan

--

- Big redesign was already done, it was a matter of ajusting here and there

--

- No need to mount parallel structures again

#### .right[.green[Can't we just rely on smart path aliasing?]]

```python

```python

    "users/<int:pk>/",
    UserDetailUpdateView.as_view(),
    name="user_detail_update",
    old=[
        "users/<int:pk>/invite/",
        "users/<int:pk>/toggle/",
